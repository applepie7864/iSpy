Process:
1) start at top left of picture and move in blocks
2) run classifier tests on each block to identify
3) to increase efficiency, we create cascades which
   are stages of tests that increase with precision
   (a block must pass all stages)
 
Note: A cascade are a collection of XML files containing
      opencv data. You initialize the code to the cascade
      you want and it does all the detection work

Creating a Custom Cascade:

Research:
- The smallest element of an image is called a pixel
- Each pixel is represented numerically through RGB or grayscale
- In the grayscale model, each pixel holds a single value representing
  the amount/intesity of light
- Features of an image are derived from pixel patterns, such as edges,
  corners and shapes. 
- When we have a large collection of these features, we can
  begin to identify things and solve tasks.
- Dark regions will have a smaller pixel sum than lighter regions
- There are 4 Haar-like features:
  a) 2 vertical rectangles (edges)
  b) 2 horizontal rectangles (edges)
  c) A centered rectangle (lines)
  d) Diagonal feature with 4 rectangles (diagonals)
- Integral images are used to efficiently calculate the sum
  of pixels in an area
- Boosting is a machine learning algorithm where classifiers
  that perform well are given greater consideration/importance or 
  a higher weight. 

Viola-Jones General Object Detection Framework:
1. Select Haar-like features
2. Create an intergral image
3. Run AdaBoost Training
4. Create classifier cascades

Process:
1) start at top left of picture and move in blocks
2) run classifier tests on each block to identify
3) to increase efficiency, we create cascades which
   are stages of tests that increase with precision
   (a block must pass all stages)
 
Note: A cascade are a collection of XML files containing
      opencv data. You initialize the code to the cascade
      you want and it does all the detection work. It is
      basically telling OpenCV what to look for in images.

Creating a Custom Cascade:
- create folders [data, for your trained classifiers]
                 [neg, does not contain object of interest]
                 [pos, contains object of interest]
                 [src, for python modules]
                 [val, for validation images]

Clarifying the Difference between Haar Cascades and Convolutional Neural Nets:
Haar cascades are mostly for the detection of eyes, face, body. Its more of machine learning concept and not very accurate.
CNN or convolutional neural nets are newer and a deep learning approach which can take in an input image, 
assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image, and be able to differentiate
one from the other. CNN are more accurate and more tools have already been built to form them. (i.e. Teachable Machine)

# Project Outline:

A webcam integrated with a live facial recognition system to help detect individuals in a database.

Motivation
In security, having a facial recognition system embedded within surveillance cameras offers several valuable capabilities. Firstly, it enables us to efficiently locate wanted criminals or missing persons. It can also be employed to supervise young children at home, informing them when it is safe to respond to visitors. Additionally, it streamlines attendance processes, minimizing the time it takes away from learning.

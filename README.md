# Project Outline:

Idea
- A webcam with a live facial recognition system to help detect individuals in a database.

Motivation
- In security, the implementation of this application into surveillance cameras will allow us to find wanted criminals or missing persons. In addition, it can be used to warn children who stay home by themselves, when to answer the door for guests, depending on whether or not their face is recognized as a known individual. It will also aid us in simplifying attendance procedures, reducing the time it takes away from learning in the classroom. By adding the pictures of people to be found in a database, we can more easily identify targeted individuals.

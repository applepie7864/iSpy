Project Outline: 

Idea
- A website that implements a webcam with a live recognition system that translates American Sign Language hand gestures to American English. 
- 
Motivation
- Implementing this application into educational systems can help students with hearing disabilities communicate with their teachers and classmates.This application can also be used in emergency situations when those with hearing impairments need to communicate with first-aid responders. Although responders may learn basic American Sign Language, not all are fluent and many may have trouble answering in stressful moments. Improvements in computer recognition software could help marginalized groups and potentially save lives. 

Technical Details
- Python
- Keras (CNN Deep Neural Nets)
- Web Design: HTML/CSS/JS, Figma
- OpenCV
